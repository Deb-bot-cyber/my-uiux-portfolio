          Namaste! I'm Debashis Barman, a CS Undergrad student from JIS College of Engineering
           â€” and an Indian UI/UX Designer and Front-End Developer based in the India. I'm passionate about using
          my design to improve the lives of others, and I am always eager to
          learn new things everyday. In my spare time, I enjoy Designing,
          video editing, and spending time with my laptop. I am passionate
          about designing user experiences that are pleasant, meaningful, and
          powerful.
